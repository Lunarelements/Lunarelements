## ü§î What is this?

This human user guide (HUG) exists thanks to a talk given by [Alex Witherspoon](https://github.com/alexwitherspoon) to the [#DigitalAF](https://digitalaf.ca/) team
in 2021. If someone were to pick this up as a manual to try and get the Bradley-Bot-3000 working, it probably wouldn't help too much but it should at least give
them an idea of who I am and what I do. The ultimate goal is to have it be a way to humanize myself and explore what I may know or not know while giving me some
ideas of what I need to work on.

## üòé About Me

I'm a technology loving Canadian üá®üá¶ with a knack for all kinds of things. I like to think of myself as someone who is a jack of all trades but master of none.

I've played a number of sports both competitively and recreationally and if you can name it I've probably had a go at it at one point or another. ‚öΩÔ∏è Outside of my obsession with technology, I also have a passion for [art](https://tripleresolution.com/) üé® and making things with my 3D printer!

## üí™ Personal Principles and Values

I believe in:

- Giving things a try, no matter if you might fail along the way.
- Breaking things, because fixing them is the best way to learn how they work.
- Asking for what you want, nobody can read your mind and do things for you.
- Getting into the action, you can plan all day but eventually you gotta get some work done to see results.

## üë®‚Äçüíª How I Feel About Teamwork
My feelings towards teamwork are pretty strong. Though I can work alone, I also thrive in an environment with others. I think the following two quotes sum this up
quite well.

The first great quote is something that I only learned just now is really a misquote from Aristotle that I'll use anyways since its still relevant to what
I was trying to say: "The whole is greater than the sum of its parts." I truly believe you're at your best when working with others to achieve something greater
than what you could achieve alone.

The second quote comes from Confucius: "If you are the smartest person in the room, then you are in the wrong room." I stand to gain a lot from putting myself in
situations where I may not be the best so that I can learn from the best. I also bring my own bests to the table where I can teach others. When you build each other
up, you can get the best outcomes.

## üíª Tech Tech Tech

Tech is my jam and while I have my own five cents on certain aspects of tech, it's hard to deny its just all around awesome. While most of my work is done with
software, I do dabble in the physical / hardware world from time to time. I am big into augmented reality (AR), the cloud and machine learning / AI.

Since this is not a resume and I have too many tech things to list, here are a few of my strong ones:

## üì¢ Feedback

I want to hear where I can improve and what things I can do differently. While I'm confident in my skills, I know that I don't know everything. I'd love you to
hit me with small things or even the big things you think would make my life different in interesting ways.

I challenge you to PR and tell me things I can do differently or even make a HUG of your own!
